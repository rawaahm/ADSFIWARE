# ADSFIWARE
FIWARE is an open-source advanced cloud IoT ecosystem. It deals with IoT data as a collection of contextual components known as entities. In FIWARE platform, each IoT object is called entity that could be hardware or software. This context entity is distinguished by specifying unique identification and type. Moreover, these entities have attributes defined by name, type, and value as can be described in figure (1).The creation of entities and the update of any existing entities is known as events.

The main component of FIWARE is the Context Broker, which provides contextual identification and addressing of IoT data. FIWARE handles context IoT data by using a publish/subscribe mechanism over NGSI interface protocol. A subscriber subscribes for either new entity or any potential changes in the existing entity by subscription while the publisher is responsible of generating the context entity and send it to the subscriber by notifications
